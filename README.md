# Inhabitent Supply Co. 

1. Use the CMS Wordpress to built out a multipage website
2. using a custome starter theme 
3. becoming familiar with WP pages, posts, plugins
4. using custom field suite to include metadata
5. build out custom widgets


With this project I started off somewhat unorganized as I didnt fully understand how much i was able to manipulate the starter theme/templates that we used. I also didnt realize how large the site ended up being and had a hard time accomplishing the required goals on time. Moving forward I would spend more time on the front end setting up a plan for moving through the project in an organized fashion. I found myself starting to work on something and then getting frustrated commiting those changes and moving on before coming back and finishing what needed to be done in a single area, i need to stick with one section and complete it and make smaller commits. I was unable to get my jquery search bar to work and realize that is something I should have tried to get done sooner and looked for help in class.
